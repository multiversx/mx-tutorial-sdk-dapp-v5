WORKFLOW:

1. Create the final version of the project
2. Split the project into steps (videos)
3. Create a folder for each step called VIDEO_NUMBER
4. Create a VIDEO_NUMBER_README.md in each folder
5. Create a .sh file for each step of the video
6. Create a run.sh main file in each folder that runs all the steps of the video

Filming:
1. Create a global tests folder
2. Replicate the VIDEO_NUMBER folder structure in the tests folder
3. In each folder create a step_VIDEO_NUMBER_step_title.ts file for each step of the video




- for each .sh file you need to create a playwight spec.ts test file
- the tests will run with chromium.launchPersistentContext
